3v to 5v with LC filter

Eagle 7, with gerbers for CNC board, single sided. tested on 40W laser and Analog/PWM IN power supply.

I had better results with this, than with the transistor methods, or bi directional shifters, this level shifter can run faster too.

used the 5v vreg added to the smooothieboard as the 5v source
